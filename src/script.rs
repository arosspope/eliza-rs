//! The script defines a set of rules which enable ELIZA to engage in discourse with a user.
//!
//! The beauty of ELIZA's design methodology means that the role of the programmer and playwright
//! are separated. An important property of ELIZA is that a script is data - it is not part of the
//! program itself. Hence, ELIZA is not restricted to a particular set of recognition patterns or
//! responses, indeed not even to any specific language.
//!
//! ## Script Structure
//!
//! The script is written in `json` and is composed of the following.
//!
//! ```json,no_run
//! {
//!     "greetings" : ["", ...],
//!     "farewells" : ["", ...],
//!     "fallbacks" : ["", ...],
//!     "transforms" : [
//!         {"word": "", "equivalents": ["", ...]},
//!         ...
//!     ],
//!     "synonyms" : [
//!         {"word": "", "equivalents": ["", ...]},
//!         ...
//!     ],
//!     "reflections" : [
//!         {"word": "", "inverse": ["", ...], "twoway": bool},
//!         ...
//!     ],
//!     "keywords" : [
//!         {
//!             "key": "", "rank": number,
//!             "rules": [
//!                 {
//!                     "memorise": bool, "decomposition_rule": rust_regex,
//!                     "reassembly_rules": ["", ...]
//!                 },
//!                 ...
//!             ]
//!         },
//!         ...
//!     ]
//! }
//! ```
